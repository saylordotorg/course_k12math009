**Unit 3: Linear Equations and Inequalities in Two Variables** <span
id="3"></span> 
*Suppose you know the age and weight of your dog and like to feed her a
combination of wet and dry food. Based on the information provided on
the packaging of the food, you have to determine what combination of
amounts of wet and dry food you could feed the dog. An inequality would
assist you in this matter.*  
    
 *Suppose you go to the candy store with a budgeted amount of money. You
want to know how many of each type of two candies you could purchase to
stay within that budget. Writing an equation and/or an inequality or
viewing the graph could quickly tell you the different combinations you
could buy to spend exactly the amount of money you have or stay under
budget.*  
    
 *This unit covers equations and equalities in two variables. *

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 8.25 hours.

**3.1 Discrete and Continuous Linear Functions** <span id="3.1"></span> 
*If you wanted to track your speed versus your time on a trip, or if you
wanted to collect data on people’s shoe sizes versus their age, you
would have to know what type of graph would be needed.*  
    
 *In subunit 3.1, you will explore when to use a discrete graph and when
to use a continuous graph.*

**3.2 Average Rate of Change** <span id="3.2"></span> 
*Most people think of skiing when they hear the term slope. If you are a
beginning skier, then you want a less steep slope, but the experienced
skier wants a steep hill. This is the concept of slope, steepness.*  
    
 *We encounter other slopes every day, such as when we climb up a hill
and walk on a ramp. *

**3.2.1 Types of Rates of Change and Determining Rates of Change** <span
id="3.2.1"></span> 
*In subunit 3.2.1, you will learn about the different rates of changes
that we call slopes and learn how to calculate rate of change.*

*When some people get up, the first thing they do is brush their teeth;
others take a shower, and some people might eat breakfast, but they are
all getting ready to start their day. There are multiple ways of
accomplishing a task, just as there are multiple methods to graphing an
equation. In this unit, you will explore this multitude of graphing
methods.*

**3.3.1.1 Tables** <span id="3.3.1.1"></span> 
*It would be very helpful for you to keep all of your notes together in
one place, such as in a binder or folder for each subject. It would also
be helpful for you to keep information for each equation in a nice neat
table. The table method is an organized manner of keeping the x and the
y categorized to make it easier to graph the equation. In subunit
3.3.1.1, you will graph lines by making tables.*

**3.4 Inequalities in Slope-Intercept Form and Standard Form** <span
id="3.4"></span> 
*The difference between an inequality and an equation is that an
equation has to be exactly equal to something, whereas an inequality can
be equal to an amount, but it could also be less than or greater than an
amount as well. You will be using many of the concepts you previously
learned for solving equations, with a few extra steps added in. In this
unit, you will be working with graphing, writing, and modeling with
inequalities.*

**3.4.1 Graphing an Inequality** <span id="3.4.1"></span> 
*If I am told that the number of people attending an event is less than
60, there are many options for how many people might come. In planning
for the event, you would consider that there might be 20 people, or
there might be 40 people. When graphing an inequality, you have to keep
all those potential options in mind. In subunit 3.4.1, you will learn
how to graph an inequality.*

section. However, this time, instead of being given an inequality and
graphing it, you will be given the graph and you will then write the
inequality.*
