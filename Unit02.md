**Unit 2: Linear Equations and Inequalities in One Variable** <span
id="2"></span> 
*Suppose you are backpacking through Europe this summer. As you’re
getting ready to pack, you check the temperatures in the areas you will
be traveling and realize those countries use Celsius when displaying
temperatures. You are used to seeing temperatures displayed in
Fahrenheit, because that is what is commonly used in the United States.
You could use a simple formula to determine this conversion.*  
    
 *Imagine you are throwing a fundraising dance. After much planning, you
have spent $1,500 on the DJ, decorations, and some snacks. Tickets are
on sale for $15. Since profit is important from a fundraiser, an
equation could be utilized to determine how much money would be
collected given a specific amount of tickets sold or an inequality could
assist in determining the amount of tickets needed to be sold to produce
a profit. By the end of this unit, you will be able to analyze this
situation.*  
    
 *This unit addresses basic linear equations and inequalities,
expressions, and formulas.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 10.75 hours.

**2.1 Linear Equations** <span id="2.1"></span> 

*<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In order to understand if
a problem makes sense, it is important to be able to justify the steps
in solving a problem as well as understand what the problem is asking
and whether the solution you arrived at is reasonable. If you start off
with 3 oranges and you bought 4 more oranges, would it make sense to end
up with 1 orange? A lot of times, a solution does not make sense, and it
is difficult to determine your mistake, but if steps are justified, the
mistake is easier to find. In this unit, you will solve equations using
justifiable steps.</span>*

**2.1.2 Solving** <span id="2.1.2"></span> 

*<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Hot and cold. Up and
down. Right and left. What do these combinations have in common? They
are opposites. This is the thinking that you use when solving an
equation. Subtraction and addition as well as multiplication and
division will be some of the opposites you will use when solving an
equation. When working with a problem involving a variable, your goal is
to isolate the variable from the rest of the terms. </span>*

*<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span>*

*<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In subunit 2.1.2, think
about doing the opposite operations in order to isolate the variable
from the rest of the problem. Since this section was covered in a
Pre-algebra course, you will go straight to an assessment to see what
you remember.  </span>*

**2.2 Solving Linear Inequalities** <span id="2.2"></span> 
*It is tax-free day, so you decide to go shopping. You are going to buy
3 pairs of jeans for $30 each and you want to buy some shirts that are
on sale for $10. What is the maximum number of shirts you can buy if you
are on a budget of $145? You could solve an inequality to represent this
problem such as 3(30) + 10x \< 145, where x represents the amount of
shirts. You encounter representing these inequalities in the real world
even if you are not formally writing them down on paper. *

**2.2.1 Solving** <span id="2.2.1"></span> 
*In subunit 2.2.1, you will solve linear inequalities that are very

assessments because they should be review material for you.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and then click on
    “Notes: Solving Compound Inequalities.” This PowerPoint presentation
    will explain how to solve inequalities and graph them on a number
    line. While viewing this presentation, you should work out the
    guided problems before viewing the solutions and then at the end of
    the presentation, there is a self-check quiz.  
        
     Completing this exercise should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and then click on
    “ExamView Quiz: Compound Inequalities.” When completed, this can be
    automatically scored with a click of the “Check Your Work” button.
    Once scored, the site will also provide the correct answers for any
    that were wrong. Once the quiz is scored, you should rework the
    problems by using the “Retake” button or retry the problems using
    the answers and working backward. Once corrected, you could start
    the quiz again or just attempt to rework the problems you answered
    incorrectly. If you struggled with the quiz, there is a compounds
    inequality worksheet that you can complete; however, it does not
    come with an answer key.  
                                                      
     Taking this quiz itself should take approximately 30 minutes.

**2.3 Literal Equations** <span id="2.3"></span> 
*We are so used to equations being in the y = form, but we do not always
see them in that format. Sometimes, we have to highlight what letter we
are solving for and use all of the methods of solving equations that we
have learned to solve for a specific letter. Later this will help us
when using formulas to model a real-world situation.*  
    
 *In subunit 2.3, you will solve equations for a specified letter. *
