Course Syllabus for "K12MATH009: Algebra I"
-------------------------------------------

Algebra is incorporated into a lot of daily activities even when you
don’t realize you are using it. Whether you are planning a vacation,
deciding on a job, shopping, building something, planning a party,
monitoring your heartbeat, or dieting, algebra can help you get a job
done or make successful decisions. This course includes 10 units that
will help you in this endeavor. This course is a continuation of the
development of concepts and problem-solving methods learned in
pre-algebra courses. Topics in this course include expressions,
functions, equations and inequalities, exponentials, quadratics,
piecewise and absolute value functions, systems, and statistics. The
purpose of this course is to build a strong algebra background that is
needed to be successful in the upper level mathematics courses, as well
as to gain the logic needed to solve real-world applications. In Unit 1,
you will build on your skills with activities that will help with the
modeling and graphing in all future units. You will also build on your
knowledge of expressions, functions, equations, and inequalities. These
skills are used to help build an understanding of the solving, graphing,
and modeling that will be incorporated into future units. The extension
of expressions and functions will help with formulas that are introduced
in Unit 2. Equations and inequalities are further emphasized in Units 2
and 3. Unit 2 covers one variable type and Unit 3 covers two variables.
Unit 4 takes your linear knowledge to a new level and applies it to
fitting statistical data. In Unit 5, you will use your knowledge of
graphing, solving, equations, and inequalities and incorporate it into
systems. In Units 6 and 7, you will use the concepts you learned in the
previous units and apply them to exponentials. In Unit 8, you will
extend these concepts to absolute value and piecewise functions, while
in Unit 9, you will tackle quadratic functions. Finally, you will end
with statistics and different types of displays. Each unit will be a
building block for the next unit. Throughout all of these units,
real-world situations will be modeled.

### Learning Outcomes

### Course Information

Welcome to Algebra I. Below you will find general information on this
course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designer:** Michelle Bell  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   [Henrico County Public
    Schools](http://teachers.henrico.k12.va.us/math/HCPSAlgebra1/index.html) This
    site has extra practice on topics that are not listed within the
    course. If you are struggling with a topic, it would be a good idea
    to review some of the supplemental material on this site.  
-   [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) This site has extra
    videos and practice on topics that are not listed within the course.
    If you are struggling with a topic, it would be a good idea to
    review some of the supplemental material on this site.
-   [Illustrative
    Mathematics](http://www.illustrativemathematics.org/) This site has
    tasks (concepts modeled mostly with real world word problems) on
    several concepts. The tasks listed on this site correspond to
    Pre-algebra problems, Algebra 1 problems, Algebra 2 problems, and
    Geometry problems.
-   [HippoCampus](http://www.hippocampus.org/) This site has extra
    practice on topics that are not listed within the course. If you are
    struggling with a topic, it would be a good idea to review some of
    the supplemental material on this site.
-   [cK-12](http://www.ck12.org/student/) This site has explanations on
    several math topics listed within the course. If you are struggling
    with a topic, this site will allow you to search for more
    assistance.
-   [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/exploringmath/algebra1/index.html) This
    site has articles and math problem sets that use information about
    different NASA missions. For more practice, choose ‘Algebra 1’ from
    the menu on the left side of the ‘Exploring Space through Math’
    page. 

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
These assigned materials include readings, videos, PowerPoint
presentations, exercises, tasks, assessments, graphing calculator
practices, and a final exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the other assignments listed in the above paragraph.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** Completing this course should take you a total of
approximately **32.75 hours**. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. It
may be useful to take a look at these time advisories and determine how
much time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit and to
then set goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take
approximately 10.5 hours. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar
and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 50 minutes) on Monday
night; subunit 1.2 (a total of 3 hours) on Tuesday and Wednesday night;
etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** It would be helpful to have a notebook or binder
for all the materials you will complete in this course. As you read or
watch videos and PowerPoint presentations, take careful notes on a
separate sheet of paper. Mark down any important equations, formulas,
and definitions that stand out to you. It will be useful to use all of
this work as a review prior to completing the final exam.  
    
 While you are working through the course, focus on understanding what
you are doing. The early material creates the tools that you will use in
later sections, so make sure you do not skip over it. Solutions are
included in most exercises to check your work and to be utilized as a
learning tool. When you answer incorrectly or are having trouble with a
problem, you can use the provided solutions to work backward to
understand the process. When you are struggling with a topic even after
exploring all the given resources, searching the web for additional
assistance or visiting some of the above sites for supplemental
explanations or practice would be very useful. Some other useful
internet sites are [www.quizlet.com](http://www.quizlet.com/) which is a
study site that houses several of the topics within this course and can
be used as a study tool,
[www.purplemath.com](http://www.purplemath.com/), which has explanations
and step-by-step guidance and examples,
[www.brightstorm.com/math](http://www.brightstorm.com/math) which has
videos to view for concepts as well as practice problems, and
[www.mathhelp.com](http://www.mathhelp.com/) which is a site with videos
on topics covered in this course with practice worksheets and
solutions.
