**Unit 1: Connecting Patterns and Functions** <span id="1"></span> 
*Suppose you want to lose weight because you currently weigh 115 pounds
and you want to wrestle in the 105-pound weight class. If you knew you
could lose 3.5 pounds each week, an expression would assist in creating
a weight-loss strategy to reach your goal.*  
    
 *Imagine you and your friends are talented at making dresses and you
want to start your own business. You are all very interested in earning
money; however, you are a little nervous since the start-up fees and
costs to make each dress are very expensive. Your job is to determine a
price to charge for each dress that would be fair to the customer but
would still earn you a profit. Luckily, one of your friend’s fathers has
offered his basement to use as a workshop for free, so you will not need
to worry about renting shop space. It will cost approximately $25 per
dress for materials, which you can purchase through a wholesale company.
Before you determine what to charge for each dress, you must test a
couple of different prices and determine which one will be most
appealing to your market but still be enable you to earn a decent
profit. A variety of strategies within this unit could assist you in
accomplishing this endeavor.*  
  
 *This unit covers expressions, displays, basic equations and
inequalities, functions, and units.*

**1.1 Order of Operations** <span id="1.1"></span> 
*If Dominic goes grocery shopping and buys 2 bags of oranges for $5.99
each and a loaf of bread for $1.50 and has a coupon for the bread for
$0.50 and then has to pay 6% tax on the food, the order of which these
numbers are used to compute the bill is very important. This is the
order of operations. If everyone did not follow the correct order, a
variety of amounts would be calculated and the cashier would not know
how much the customer would need to pay.*  
  
 *The order of operations is the foundation for almost every
mathematical topic covered in this course, as well as other future
mathematical courses. It helps serve as the one way of interpreting
mathematical statements so that everyone performs the operations in the
correct order as well in the correct direction.*  
  
 *Subunit 1.1 covers the rules of the order of operations when
performing a problem manually and then suggests learning how to check a
solution using a calculator.*

**1.2 Expressions** <span id="1.2"></span> 
*Algebraic expressions are how we speak on a daily basis. “I’m two years
older than my sister” translates to 2 + x where x is the age of the
sister. “My paycheck was $60 less than last week” translates to x – 60
where x is the amount of last week’s paycheck. “The bill from the
restaurant is being split amongst four people” can be translated to x /
4 where x is the cost of the bill. “I have to double the recipe for the
amount of people I have to serve” can be translated to 2x where x is the
amount of the original recipe.*  
  
 *Even though variables mixed with numbers can be intimidating at times,
those variables, numbers, and operations, are a part of our daily life
and conversation and can help us solve many problems.*

**1.2.1 Definition of Expression** <span id="1.2.1"></span>

**1.2.2 Parts of an Expression** <span id="1.2.2"></span> 
*Simplifying by combining like terms is a process we use daily without
realizing that algebra is involved. When cleaning out the dishwasher, we
put the dishes in one spot and the silverware in another spot and we
even break it down more, the bowls with the bowls and the forks with the
forks.*  
    
 *If you work at a daycare and are chaperoning a trip to McDonald’s
where the toddler class has 5 boys and 7 girls and the primary class has
2 boys and 9 girls, you would tell the cashier when ordering the happy
meals that you have 7 boys and 16 girls, so that you get the appropriate
toy for each child.*  
    
 *There is no difference when viewing an expression with variables and
numbers. The variables are like representing the boys and the girls and
the coefficients are representing the amount of each. The plus sign
represents the amount of happy meals I have so that McDonald’s knows how
many need to be included in my bill.*  
    
 *Subunit 1.2.2 focuses on the rules of combining like terms to simplify
an expression while still utilizing the order of operations learned in a
previous section.*

**1.2.3 Evaluating an Expression** <span id="1.2.3"></span> 
*In a shopping ad for Kohl’s, it states that the sale price for all
jeans is $25 and the sale price for all shoes is $30. I could easily
calculate that if I want 4 pairs of jeans and 2 pairs of shoes, I would
spend $160 without tax. I just evaluated an expression because the jeans
could be x and the shoes could be y to create 25x + 30y where I plug in
how many I want of each for the variables.*  
    
 *Your everyday life includes expressions whether or not you are writing
them down using variables, numbers, and operations.*

**1.2.4 Simplifying an Expression** <span id="1.2.4"></span> 
*Think back to the McDonald’s scenario. If you know how many boys’ Happy
Meals you need and you know how many girls’ Happy Meals you need and you
know the cost of each Happy Meal, a distribution expression, cost (boys’
amount + girls’ amount) is made. This type of algebraic structure is
used daily even if you are not writing variables on paper.*  
    
 *In subunit 1.2.4, you will combine some of the topics learned in
previous sections and classes, such as the order of operations,
combining like terms, and the distributive property, to simplify
expressions.*

**1.3 Unit Analysis** <span id="1.3"></span> 

*<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">When asked for the
temperature, we use an answer such as 60 degrees; when asked how much
something costs, we respond with something such as 60 dollars; when
asked for how fast we were driving, we say something like 60 miles per
hour. We attach units to our responses. </span>*

*<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span>*

*<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Many problems involve
determining a variable that is representing an unknown value, so it is
important to consider what the answer represents. The same applies when
viewing graphs because they help us visualize data. To ensure everyone
views the data the same, it is important to label the graphs’ axes and
their scales. </span>*

**1.3.1 Converting Units Using Dimensional Analysis** <span
id="1.3.1"></span> 
*If you were trying to purchase carpet for your bedroom and measured
your floor in feet, but when you went to the store, the dimensions were
posted in inches, you would have to convert to see how much carpet you
had to purchase. Sometimes the units you have are not the units that
will help you solve a problem. In these cases, you have to convert to
the units needed.*  
    
 *In subunit 1.3.1, you will learn how to convert units using a
horizontal analysis method. This method is used a lot in chemistry, so
in the video, the presenter will reference to this subject.*

**1.3.2 Significant Digits** <span id="1.3.2"></span> 
*In math and science, exaggerating a number’s accuracy can lead to
errors. If you go to the store and the bill is $4.07, you can’t just
give the cashier $4.00 and say you rounded the bill. If you go to the
home improvement store and need 35.45 yards of carpet, you won’t just
buy 35 yards. Carefully providing accurate measurements and calculations
is a concept we have to use in real-world situations. In subunit 1.3.3,
you will learn the importance of numbers in a topic called significant
digits.*

**1.6 Functions** <span id="1.6"></span> 
*Sometimes it is difficult to model real-world situations, and the best
way is to try to fit data through functions. “The volume of a sphere
depends on its radius.” “The amount of money John makes depends upon the
number of hours he works.” “The grade that Marissa received in the class
depends upon the number of points she has earned.” These are examples of
functional relationships where one variable depends upon another
variable. In this unit, you will learn concepts of functions.*

**1.6.1 What Is a Function?** <span id="1.6.1"></span> 
*In subunit 1.6.1, you will extend your knowledge of ordered pairs and
graphs to determining if they represent a function.*

every input, there can only be one output (every x can only have one
y).*

**1.6.3 Function Notation** <span id="1.6.3"></span> 
*You, or someone you know, might have one nickname at home and a
different nickname at school. You might know a friend as Lizzy, but her
family calls her Elizabeth. She is the same person no matter what name
she is called. We see a similar idea in function notation. We are used
to viewing equations in y = , but now we will see a function notation
such as f(x) = . We are used to writing ordered pairs such as (5, 4),
but now we might see the format f(5) = 4. These are all different ways
of referring to a function.*  
    
 *In subunit 1.6.3, you will learn the meaning of function notation and
how to work with that format.*
