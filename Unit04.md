**Unit 4: Data** <span id="4"></span> 
*Suppose you belong to a gym that has posters displayed to help members
focus on reaching their peak heart rate during workouts. Age is given in
years, and peak heart rate is in beats per minute (BPM). This would make
it very easy to determine what your peak heart rate should be if your
age is listed. However, if your age is not listed, a data display or a
line of best fit would be beneficial in determining this information.*  
    
 *This unit addresses data displays and fitting lines to data.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 3.25 hours.

**4.1 Scatter Plots and Correlation** <span id="4.1"></span> 
*Data is all around us. We see it on the television and in the papers.
It is used in a variety of situations. One way to display data is
through a scatter plot. In subunit 4.1, you will learn what a scatter
plot is and what the possible relationships are among the given data.*

**4.2 Line of Best Fit** <span id="4.2"></span> 
*Since a scatter plot is not exactly linear, a line of best fit has to
be drawn. What line would best model the data? Depending upon the data,
sometimes the line is a good fit and sometimes it is a bad fit. In
subunit 4.2, you will use the graphing utility to determine the line of
best fit.*

**4.3 Residuals** <span id="4.3"></span> 
*At the fair, you can always find the game where a person guesses your
weight. Usually the guess is not accurate. How far off the actual weight
is from the prediction is part of the residual concept. In this unit,
you will explore the concept of residuals.*
